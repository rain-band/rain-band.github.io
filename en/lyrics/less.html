<p>When I point my finger at the surface of the water, it reflects an afterimage, and my eyes in the afterimage were sad.<br>
The door of the wind opens, the dead leaves flow.<br>
Depressing time also flows.<br>
No more pretending... Now the moon hides the sun...</p>

<p>Waiting for the birds to sing and offering my hands.<br>
The morning-sun sets.<br>
The moon is reflected in white. Acting in broad daylight.<br>
Reflected the sky of that day.<br>
Don't take away anybody... Now the tears are falling...</p>

<p>Like an ephemeral cradle rocking, someday it will be a distant memory.<br>
I collected glass fragments in the season when you're not here.</p>

<p>Like a crumbling sandcastle, disappearing in the waves...<br>
-Footprints-</p>

<p>...The snow begins to melt...</p>

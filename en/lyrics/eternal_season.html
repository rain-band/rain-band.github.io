<p>A chilly wind blew through the window.<br>
When I woke up at night, I lightly looked into the sky.<br>
There was only the moonlight in the black space.<br>
The dimmed light wrapped up only my loneliness...</p>

<p>At the time of being consumed by anxiety,<br>
I waited intently for listening to your voice.<br>
With a discomfort is entangled in my feet,<br>
I groveled in the discomfort...</p>

<p>In the season of only I and you, in the time of only I and you, we built a bond of only I and you.<br>
Last promise, last kiss, and finally, your whereabouts.</p>

<p>On the night when I was informed the eternal farewell,<br>
I was left alone and murmured...<br>
"Don't go anywhere"<br>
If you can't stop it, I wish this moment would never end...<br>
The memory of time, the scar of time...<br>
"I wish you were here too"</p>

<p>You made me feel eternity that should not exist.<br>
I want to be with you forever and ever in the eternal season...</p>

<p>In the morning that I felt your temperature,<br>
I embraced you with a frozen body.<br>
"I never forget you forever and ever"<br>
The trembling voice echoing in the room.<br>
"If you close your eyes, tomorrow will come again..."<br>
You left saying it<br>
"Goodbye"</p>

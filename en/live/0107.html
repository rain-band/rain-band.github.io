<p>LAST SONG - "less"</p>
<hr>
<p>Today is the last day to see RAIN... So I took more pictures than usual!</p>

<p>There were about five costume changes this day.</p>
<p>Black costume -&gt; Kinu-Kumo's costume -&gt; TOKKOUFUKU (特攻服) -&gt; White costume -&gt; Black suit</p>

<p>The first song of the live was "less". Everyone was jumping up and down and having fun with "less".</p>

<p>They performed an arranged version of "Kinu-Kumo", a new song called "RAIN ~Uruwashii Oto~", a drum solo, and many other rare songs that I don't usually hear in a live performance.</p>

<p>Maybe they were nervous because it was the last live. For example, during the MC, Fumiyuki didn't wander around as much as usual and seemed more awkward than usual.</p>

<p>The songs from the demo tape "Eien" were on repeat the whole time we were waiting for the costume change.</p>

<p>This live was quite long. There were 18 songs, MC, lottery, SE, and waiting time for costume changes, so it took about 3 to 4 hours from the start to the end of the live. I was a new fan at the time, so I thought, "I don't know many of the songs," but looking back now, I think the setlist had the right points that "RAIN must play these songs".</p>

<p>I remember fans who had come from far and wide and left halfway through the show in frustration because of the last train.</p>

<p>At the about end of the show, they had a raffle to give away some stage costumes.</p>

<p>RAIN's final song was "less". The last song "less" was a sad feeling. I felt that "less" was a wonderful song that showed many different expressions even though it was the same song. "less" is my favorite song, so I was very happy that they played it again at the very end of the last live and closed the last live with this song!</p>

<p>After the performance, I went outside and saw that it was snowing a little bit.</p>

<p>Then I attended the banquet at an IZAKAYA (居酒屋).</p>

<p><img src="../../image/fumiyuki.jpg" alt="麗音 文有希"></p>

<p>When the banquet was almost over, my friend said, "Since you're here, why don't you talk to Fumiyuki?" and I managed to get up the courage to take a picture of him.</p>

<p>To be honest, I was really nervous.</p>

<p>I had never talked to a band member before, and he was more than 10 years older than me, and most importantly, he was Fumiyuki.</p>

<p>I had no idea that this would be my last chance to take pictures of him.</p>

<p>I'm sure he didn't want to upload this picture because he was drunk and had no makeup on, but for me, it's a treasure! I'll treasure forever!</p>

<p>When the launch was over, the snow outside was getting heavier.</p>

<p>It was cold anyway.</p>

<p>I managed to find shelter from the snow, and waited for the first train to depart, freezing and shivering.</p>

<p>I don't remember if the temperature gauge in front of the station read 0°C or minus, but it was quite low.</p>

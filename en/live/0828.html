<p>This day is my first visit to live house and RAIN's live!</p>
<p>RAIN performed at the end. When RAIN came on stage, there was a rope stretched across the stage. The costumes on this day were almost the same as the ones on the jacket of "Kinu-Kumo" demo tape.</p>
<p>The song "less" had a sad feeling to it. The stage was lit up with blue lights during the intro part of "less", and I thought it matched the mood of this song.</p>
<p>By the end of the live, I was completely captivated by RAIN&hearts;</p>

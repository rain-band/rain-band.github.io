<h1>About this RAIN unofficial site</h1>
<hr>
<p>On April 5, 2003, Fumiyuki, the vocalist of RAIN, passed away. For this reason, unfortunately, the complete revival of RAIN is no longer possible.
So I created this site in the hope that there would be a place where people could remember RAIN, at least a little.</p>
